"""What "fully scraped" means for one analysed profile, in one place.

THE GAP THIS CLOSES
    `profile_repository.RETRYABLE_ANALYSIS_STATUSES` already re-queues a
    row whose analysis STATUS says the profile was never actually looked
    at (ERROR/CHECKPOINT/LOGIN_REQUIRED/PARTIAL). It has no opinion at all
    about a row that came back status OK carrying half its fields, and
    that is the shape almost every real loss takes: the page loaded, the
    name and follower count came through, and the last-post date (or the
    evidence screenshot) simply was not on screen yet when it was read.

    Measured on one 663-URL run before this existed: 76 of 148 Twitter
    rows had no last-post date, 82 of 211 Instagram rows had none, and 28
    Instagram rows had no screenshot -- every one of them status OK or
    PARTIAL, none of them ever retried, because nothing in the pipeline
    could tell "this profile genuinely has no posts" apart from "we did
    not manage to read them this time".

WHY IT IS SAFE TO RETRY ON THIS
    `profile_repository.save()` writes only non-blank values
    (`v not in (None, "", {})`), so attempts MERGE: a second visit can
    fill a field the first one missed and can never blank one the first
    one got. Re-attempting an incomplete row is therefore monotonic -- it
    either improves the row or leaves it exactly as it was.

WHY EVERY RULE BELOW IS CONSERVATIVE
    A field is only required when the platform genuinely publishes it for
    that KIND of profile. "Missing" has to mean "we failed to read it",
    never "this account legitimately has none", or a private account with
    no visible posts would burn its whole retry budget on every sweep
    forever and then surface as a false coverage gap. Hence the explicit
    carve-outs for confirmed-zero-post accounts, private/protected
    profiles, groups, and profiles that are already gone.

# Which platforms' analysis engines actually READ a location, established by
# reading the engines rather than assuming: facebook, twitter and youtube
# each have a location reader; instagram, tiktok and telegram have none at
# all. That matches the live data exactly -- location is blank on 100% of
# instagram (309/309) and tiktok (11/11) rows, and only sometimes blank on
# twitter (52%) and facebook (83%), which is the signature of a field that
# IS read but is genuinely optional for the account holder to set.
#
# The distinction matters for reporting, not for retry: a blank location on
# instagram is not a miss to chase, it is a field this pipeline never claims
# to collect there. Without this, 320 rows read as "data missing" forever
# and no amount of re-analysis would ever change one of them.
#
# Instagram JOINED this set on 2026-08-22. It was correctly excluded before:
# the engine genuinely had no location reader, so 309/309 blank rows were
# honestly "not-collected". It now reads `city_name` off the same
# `data.user` object it reads followers and biography from (confirmed live
# -- the key is present on every profile payload, populated on
# professional/business accounts and empty on most personal ones). A blank
# location on Instagram therefore now means what it already meant on
# Facebook and Twitter: the account holder did not set one. That changes how
# a blank is EXPLAINED (see field_report below), not whether it triggers a
# retry -- location is never one of the fields `missing_fields` checks for
# on ANY platform, cookie-authed or not, because its absence is never, on
# its own, evidence the scraper failed: a platform publishes it only if the
# account holder filled it in. Re-visiting a profile that simply has no
# location set would burn its retry budget on something no visit could ever
# produce, so it is left out of that function entirely rather than gated by
